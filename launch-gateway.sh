# Open a web page to the gateway to the current connection.
# This was written to get around how, too often, the "Login" page never auto-displays
# when connecting to a public network that requires accepting a license, logging in,
# etc. in order to access the network.
# For conveninence, I add a keyboard shortcut of Ctrl-Alt-G to bring this up when needed.

# This has been tested on Fedora 39 Cinnamon and works well.
# It should work under Ubuntu and downstream with little or no changes.

# Confirm there is a network connection

# Usage: nohup launch_gateway {browser} 2\> /dev/null
